# The category (or categories) of your library, must be from the following list:

# If a value other than those listed is used, your library will listed as

# A short sentence (or fragment) to summarize the library's function. This will 
# be shown from inside the PDE when the library is being installed. Avoid 
# repeating the name of your library here. Also, avoid saying anything redundant 
# like mentioning that it's a library. This should start with a capitalized 
# letter, and end with a period.

# 'sentence' always will be prepended, so you should start by writing the

# A version number that increments once with each release. This is used to 
# compare different versions of the same library, and check if an update is 
# available. You should think of it as a counter, counting the total number of 
# releases you've had.

# The min and max revision of Processing compatible with your library.
# Note that these fields use the revision and not the version of Processing, 
# parsable as an int. For example, the revision number for 2.2.1 is 227. 
# You can find the revision numbers in the change log: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/processing/processing/master/build/shared/revisions.txt
# Only use maxRevision (or minRevision), when your library is known to 
# break in a later (or earlier) release. Otherwise, use the default value 0.
